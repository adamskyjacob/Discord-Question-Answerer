# Discord Bot

Side project working on QA bot for school Discord servers. It will be able to compile questions from dozens of schools, and will use
information from similarly structured questions to provide potential responses. There will be a standard moderation role, QA, which
will allow questions which were answered incorrectly to have correct entries entered into the training data. Additionally, inappropriate
questions can be excluded by moderators from the server in which the question was asked
